  "description" : "Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB)complaint activity data, 2005-2009.  The time it takes the NYPD to resolve substantiated cases is measured from the date that the CCRB physically transferred the case file to the department until the last day of the month in which the department closed the case. The department does not inform the CCRB of its actual disposition date —just the month in which it closed the case. In addition, when the Department Advocate's Office refers a case to a commanding officer for the imposition of a command discipline, the NYPD considers the case closed and reports that closure to the CCRB. It is subsequent to this closure date that the commanding officer decides upon a penalty consistent with the level of command discipline proscribed by the Department Advocate's Office. For cases that proceeded to administrative hearings, the time it takes for judges to render written decisions is included in calculating the department's closure time.\r\nUpdate Schedule: Annually",
