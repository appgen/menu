AppGen: Menu
===
Hosted on Heroku: http://bigappgen.herokuapp.com
To login (not working yet): http://bigappgen.herokuapp.com/submit
To browse apps: http://bigappgen.herokuapp.com/submit/apps

I propose these routes

    /
    /a -> Display titles, screenshots, &c. of a few apps with links to the apps.
    /a/:seed -> An app
    /a/:seed/map -> An app's map page
    /a/:seed/contact -> An app's contact page
    /a/:seed/styles.css -> And so on
